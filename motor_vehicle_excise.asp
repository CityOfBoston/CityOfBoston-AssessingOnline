General Laws imposes an excise on the privilege of registering a motor vehicle or a trailer in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The excise is levied annually in lieu of a tangible personal property tax. Non-registered vehicles, however, remain subject to taxation as personal property.
<br /><br />
The excise is levied by the city or town where the vehicle is principally garaged and the revenues become part of the local community treasury.
<br /><br />
The Registry of Motor Vehicles prepares data for excise bills according to the information on the motor vehicle registration and sends it to city or town assessors. Cities and towns then prepare bills based on excise data sent by the Registry in conformity with Department of Revenue requirements.
<br /></dd></dl><dd><h5>Motor Vehicle Valuation</h5></dd><dd><dl class="faq"><dt>How is the excise determined?</dt><dd class="hide" style="display:none;">The amount of the excise is based on the value of the motor vehicle that is based upon the manufacturer's list price.
<br /><br />
Various percentages of the manufacturer's list price are applied. The formula is as follows:
<br /><br /><ul><li>In the year preceding the designated year of manufacture
<br />
(brand new car released before model year) - 50%</li><li>In the designated year of manufacture- 90%</li><li>In the second year - 60%</li><li>In the third year - 40%</li><li>In the fourth year - 25%</li><li>In the fifth and succeeding years -10%</li></ul><p><br /><strong>Calculating the excise</strong></p><br /><div>Once the value of the vehicle is determined, an excise at the rate of $25.00 per thousand is assessed. Excises are assessed annually, on a calendar year basis, by the assessors of the city or town in which the vehicle is garaged.
<br /><br />
If the motor vehicle is registered after January 31, it is taxed for the period extending from the first day of the month in which it is registered to the end of the calendar year. For example, if a vehicle is registered on April 30, it will be taxable as of April 1, for the nine months of the year (April through December) and the excise due therefore, will be 9/12 of the full excise. In no event shall the excise be assessed for less than $5.00 nor shall an abatement or refund under Section 1 of Chapter 60A reduce an excise to less than $5.00.</div></dd></dl></dd><dd><h5>Motor Vehicle Excise Tax Payment</h5></dd><dd><dl class="faq"><dt>How do I pay the motor vehicle excise? Can I pay online?</dt><dd class="hide" style="display:none;"><p>Yes, to payÂ your Motor Vehicle Excise tax visit: <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/excise" title="Motor Vehicle Excise Tax Payment Online">Motor Vehicle Excise Tax Payment Online</a>.
<br /><br /></p><p>In person, you can visit the Collecting Division Customer Service window M-1 (Mezzanine level) at City Hall, Monday-Friday 9-5pm.</p><p>or

<br /></strong></div><div><strong><br /></strong><em>NOTE: A person who does not receive a bill is still liable for the excise plus any interest charges accrued. Therefore, it is important to keep the Registry and the US post office informed of a current name and address so that excise bills can be delivered promptly. All owners of motor vehicles must pay an excise tax; therefore, it is the responsibility of the owner to contact the TRAC office if you have not received a bill.</em><br /></div></dd></dl><dl class="faq"><dt>What happens if my payment is late?</dt><dd class="hide" style="display:none;">If an excise is not paid within 30 days from the issue date, the local tax collector sends a demand. The charge for the demand is $5. Interest accrues on the overdue bill from the day after the due date until the date of payment at an annual rate of 12 percent.
<br /><br />
If the demand is not answered within 14 days, the collector may issue a warrant to the deputy tax collector or an appointed agent. The taxpayer is then additionally liable for a warrant fee of $5. The warrant notice sent by the deputy collector (or the appointed agent) to the taxpayer costs $14.
<br /><br />
If this notice is not answered than a final warrant, a service warrant will be delivered or exhibited to the taxpayer at his/her residence or place of business at a fee of $14. All bills should clearly state the interest and penalty charges.
<br /></dd></dl><dl class="faq"><dt>How does non-payment of motor vehicle excise affect license and registration?</dt><dd class="hide" style="display:none;">If the service warrant demanding final payment is ignored, the collector may then notify the Registrar of Motor Vehicles of such non-payment, including all accrued interest and penalty fees. The Registrar may then mark the individual's registration preventing the renewal of the motor vehicle registration and the owner's driver's license until such time as the Registrar is notified that full and final payment has been made to the city or town. This payment shall include a $20 release fee as final settlement of the delinquent excise. Once the bill had been paid, the municipality will give the motorist a receipt so he or she can return to the Registry to register his/her vehicle.
<br /><br />
Although the local tax collectors do notify the Registrar that the matter is resolved, it is strongly advised to retain the certified receipt of payment for presentation to the Registry of Motor Vehicles. Cities and towns relay computerized notification that excise bills have been paid only periodically to the Registry.
<br /><br />
Under the excise tax law, tax collectors have six years from the issue date of a bill to notify the Registry of non-payment by a driver (M.G.L. c.60A, s2A), unless the tax record shows a history of non-payment. However, under the Registry's own policy, this notification time has been reduced to just two years. If the record does show a history of delinquency, the tax collectors can electronically mark the driver's record and institute proceedings to collect for as many years back (beyond six years, in other words) as necessary and notify the Registry. The Registry, in turn, reviews each notification beyond two years individually. If a taxpayer has had a good history of payment and suddenly receives a bill dating back more than six years, the assessors will assign a tax collector to collect the bill; the tax collector, in turn, will attempt to collect and assess late fees and penalties, as is required by law, if applicable. However, the collector can no longer mark the driver's record for non-payment since the Registry only allows two years for notification from the issue date of the bill. Thus, the taxpayer's ability to renew the license, in this instance, is not hampered; but the bill must still be resolved with the local tax collector.

<br /></em><br /><strong>NEW REQUIREMENTS</strong><br /></p><p>The TRAC office must receive applications within 3 years after the excise is due OR within one year after the excise is paid.</p><br /><strong>Example:</strong> Assume that an excise tax bill is due on February 25, 2016.

<br /></p><br /><p><em>If the owner moved before the first of the year, he/she must pay the tax to the new community to which the owner moved. If the owner did not notify the Registry, the local assessor, and the post office that he/she moved before the first of the year, it may be necessary to file for an abatement with the former city or town which had sent the excise bill. Most cities or towns will dismiss the bill and reroute it to the new community once the owner furnishes proof that he/she had moved before the first of the year.</em></p></dd></dl><dl class="faq"><dt>What if I sold my car?</dt><dd class="hide" style="display:none;"><p>If an excise bill is received for a vehicle or trailer that has been sold, the seller must:</p><br /><ul><li><p>Return the plate(s) to the Registry of Motor Vehicles, obtain a return plate receipt</p></li><li><p>File an application with the Taxpayer Referral & Assistance Center (TRAC) office for abatement together with the following:</p><ol><li><p>return plate receipt and the bill of sale OR</p></li><li><p>New Registration Form</p></li></ol></li></ul><p><br />
